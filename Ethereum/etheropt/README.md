EtherOpt
=============
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Etherboost/etheropt.svg)](https://gitter.im/etheropt/etheropt.github.io)

[EtherOpt](https://etheropt.github.io) is a decentralized options exchange built on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/). The options you see here are vanilla call and put options on the price of Ethereum in USD as reported by [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_eth) and [Coindesk](http://www.coindesk.com/price) and verified by [Reality Keys](https://www.realitykeys.com). EtherOpt has no owner. Its entire operation is described and executed by an Ethereum [smart contract](etheropt.sol). EtherOpt does not make any money as the smart contract does not charge any fees -- not for trading, not for adding funds, not for withdrawing, not for anything.
